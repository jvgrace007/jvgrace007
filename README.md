👋 Hi, I’m Jorge

I hold a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology and CompTIA Security+.
This profile documents my hands-on learning in system administration and SOC fundamentals through labs and projects.

I’m actively developing hands-on experience through home labs and documented projects covering:
- Windows/Linux administration
- Logging, monitoring, and alert investigation
- Entry-level SOC workflows

My goal is to transition into a SOC Analyst or Junior Systems Administrator role.
