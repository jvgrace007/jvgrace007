##👋 Hi, I’m Jorge

IT professional with a Bachelor’s in Information Technology and CompTIA Security+, focused on system administration and defensive security.

I’m actively developing hands-on experience through home labs and documented projects covering:
- Windows/Linux administration
- Logging, monitoring, and alert investigation
- Entry-level SOC workflows

My goal is to transition into a SOC Analyst or Junior Systems Administrator role.
